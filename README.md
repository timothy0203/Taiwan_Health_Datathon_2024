# Sepsis Management Analysis in Taiwan -- Taiwan_Health_Datathon_2024
=====================================

## Introduction
---------------

Sepsis is a life-threatening medical condition caused by a dysregulated response to infection, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially death. The timeliness of antibiotic administration, known as time-to-antibiotics, is a critical determinant of survival in sepsis. Our study aims to investigate sepsis management in Taiwan using a multicenter database spanning over two decades to provide insights on optimizing sepsis care in the region.

## Background
--------------

Numerous observational studies have demonstrated that delays in administering antibiotics increase mortality in sepsis. However, regional differences in healthcare systems, infection patterns, and antimicrobial resistance may impact outcomes. Our study seeks to analyze the impact of these factors on sepsis care in Taiwan.

## Dataset
----------

Our dataset consists of 4.3 million patients from a multicenter database in Taiwan, collected between 1998 and 2022. We identify patients with suspected sepsis by the presence of blood, sputum, or urine cultures and the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

## Objectives
------------

1.  Analyze the time interval between the recognition of suspected sepsis and the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2.  Investigate the influence of regional factors on sepsis care and outcomes.
3.  Assess the impact of time-to-antibiotics on the length of hospital stay and resource utilization.

## Methodology
--------------

1.  Data extraction: Extract relevant data from the multicenter database.
2.  Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess data for analysis.
3.  Statistical analysis: Utilize statistical methods to analyze the relationship between time-to-antibiotics and outcomes.
